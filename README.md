# PR280Ass-2

Create a SPA which reads text files with numbers and calculate the coefficient of determination

## Examples of what to include (choose 100%):

- [x] 1. Write a program that calculates the correlation of two arrays of numbers [20 marks]
- [x] 2. Adapt / extend the first program to calculate the regression of two arrays of numbers. [20 Marks, but deductions for DUPLICATE CODE]
- [x] 3. Provide a user interface with Vuejs [10 marks]
- [x] 4. Provide a user interface with Reactjs [10 marks]
- [ ] 5. Provide a user interface with Nodejs [10 marks]
- [x] 6. Enhance the user interface with Bootstrap css [10 marks]
- [ ] 7. Create a command line application for Nodejs that reads and write to file [10 marks]
- [ ] 8. Create a RESTful web service for Nodejs that return JSON data [10 marks]
- [x] 9. Provide Jasminejs unit tests [10 marks]
- [ ] 10. Provide Cucumberjs unit tests [10 marks]

## Notes:

There are NIL marks for the following, but it will be useful for the final 50% assessment.

	1. A plan for the work for each iteration
	2. A design level class diagram for each task.
	3. A plan for how the program feature you are working on will work.
	4. A test plan and a test report
	5. Proof the program works and passes standardJS validation
	6. Error logs
	7. Project Summary Sheets and Process Improvement Proposals

## Further notes:
* *Task 3: Provide a user interface with Vuejs*
	Students are required to use Vue.js to create <<View>> and <<Controller>> to work with the solution(s) of Task 1 and/ or 2, so that users can upload input file(s) and see the correct result(s).
* *Task 4: Provide a user interface with Reactjs*
	Students are required to use React.js to create <<View>> and <<Controller>> to work with the solution(s) of Task 1 and/ or 2, so that users can upload input file(s) and see the correct result(s).
* *Task 5: Provide a user interface with Nodejs*
	Students are required to create their own HTTP static server like the demo of "using Node.js to create HTTP static server" under the tab of "RESTful web service and HTTP server with Node.js" on our course Moodle site. This server is expected to receive a request, e.g., localhost:8081/index.html, and return the requested .html file as the response, so that users can upload input file(s) containing numbers in the .html file and then see the correct result(s). The calculation part should reuse the solutions of Task 1 and/ or 2. The calculation part can be done in either client side or server side.
* *Task 6: Enhance the user interface with Bootstrap.css*
	Students are required to use at least FIVE different types of Bootstrap.css features in their solutions.
* *Task 7: Create a command line application for Nodejs that reads and write to file*
	Please refer to the demo called "calculation on file content" under the tab of "RESTful web service and HTTP server with Node.js" on our course Moodle site. Students are required to write a Node.js command line application like the demo named "calculation on file content", which reads two input files and then reuses the solution of Task 1 and/or 2 to do the calculation and at the end outputs the result(s) calculated to a output file.
